# homebridge-cec-accessory
Homebridge support for home theater devices using CEC over HDMI

## About

homebridge-cec-accessory was written with Raspberry Pi in mind.

Create homebridge accessories for each CEC device you'd like to control.
Currently `power` and `volume` are the only available controls, and `volume`
only toggles mute (and probably only works with an attached receiver).

No automatic detection of attached devices is performed. For each device, create
an accessory entry in your `config.json`.

Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests welcome.

## Installation

### On a Raspberry Pi

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi)
to install and run homebridge on Raspberry Pi. Don't give up. Hang in there.

2. Install cec-utils using package manager:  
`$ apt-get install cec-utils`

3. Install homebridge-platform-cec:  
`$ npm install -g homebridge-cec-accessory`

4. Open an issue if you run into problems.

## Configuration

Here is a sample of what you might put in your `~/.homebridge/config.json`

```
"accessories": [
  {
    "accessory": "cec",
    "name": "TV Power",
    "type": "power",
    "address": 0
  },
  {
    "accessory": "cec",
    "name": "Amp Volume",
    "type": "volume",
    "address": 5
  }
]
```

`"name"` can be any string you want, but must be unique. Try to keep it short
and descriptive.

`"type"` must be either `"power"` or `"volume"`.

`"address"` specifies the CEC destination address of the device, represented
as an integer. Here are the possible devices:

`0`: TV  
`1`: Recording 1  
`2`: Recording 2  
`3`: Tuner 1  
`4`: Playback 1  
`5`: Audio system  
`6`: Tuner 2  
`7`: Tuner 3  
`8`: Playback 2  
`9`: Recording 3  
`10`: Tuner 4  
`11`: Playback 4

### Finding Your Devices

The best way I've found to find your devices is to use the `cec-client` tool
which comes as part of the `cec-utils` package.

From the command line:  
`$ cec-client -d 1`

Once it outputs `waiting for input`, type `scan` and press return. This might
be slightly confusing, but the number to use for `"address"` is the value
presented as `device #`, not the decimal separated IP-style address.

## Troubleshooting

Under the covers, `homebridge-cec-accessory` uses the `cec-client` to interface
with your HDMI device. Stopping and starting repeatedly can cause things to go
awry. 

If the plugin reports that `cec-client` never reported ready, it's possible
that homebridge is running as a user without access to `/dev/vchiq`. If you're
running homebridge as a user named `homebridge`, you can grant that access by
adding the user to the `video` group with: `sudo usermod -a -G video homebridge`

If this happens intermitantly, restarting may also help.

If you're having trouble doing something with this plugin, verify you can do it
with `cec-client`. If it can't, neither can we.
